ArchC Change Log, May 2013
=============================================


*------------ Version 2.2 -------------------- 
*
* + Added a instruction ./boot.sh in files README and INSTALL
*
* = Fix compilation with gcc 4.7
*           An explicit conversion between uint8_t * and ac_ptr was needed to
*           correctly match the overloaded function load_array
*
* = Fix compilation to work with std=c99 -std=c++03. Tested with:
*           - gcc 4.7.2:    
*           - gcc 4.6.3
*           - clang 3.0
*           - SystemC 2.3.0
*           - eglibc 2.15
*
* = SystemC:   
*			- Eliminate deprecation warning caused when running with SystemC 2.2.0 
*			- Full support for System 2.3.0
*
* = Switch INCLUDES to AM_CPPFLAGS in Makefile.am. INCLUDE in Makefile.am is deprecated.
*
* + Add descriptive message to configure output. Example:
*           prefix:                 /opt/archc
*           sysconfdir:             ${prefix}/etc
*           libdir:                 ${exec_prefix}/lib
*           bindir:                 ${exec_prefix}/bin
*           systemcdir:		/opt/systemc
*           tlmdir:                 /opt/systemc/include
*           binutilsdir:
*           gdbdir:
*           c compiler:             clang
*           c++ compiler:           clang++
*           cflags:                 -Werror -std=c99 -Wall
*           cxxflags:               -Werror -std=c++03 -Wall
*           ldflags:
*
* = Fix random const issues in ac_storage
*
* = Fix warning when running libtoolize
*           The two or three argument AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE call was deprecated. Part
*           of it was fixed in previous commits, this patch only suppresses the
*           warning message about  it.
*
* = Updating nightlytester to work with GIT and the new ARM model (which has a different model name).
*
* + Implemented fork syscall
*
* + MacOSX partially supported 
*           -  Adding macosx as a possible target to systemc in autoconf script
*           -  Small fix in boot script to support MacOSX libtoolize
*           -  ac_syscall modifications to support mac platforms
*           -  Add support for compiling ARCHC in MacOSX
