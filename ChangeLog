May 2013, ArchC Change Log
=============================================

* Version 2.2 released

+ Added a instruction ./boot.sh in files README and INSTALL

= Fix compilation with gcc 4.7
	* An explicit conversion between uint8_t * and ac_ptr was needed to
	* correctly match the overloaded function load_array

= Fix compilation to work with std=c99 -std=c++03. Tested with:
	* gcc 4.7.2:    
	* gcc 4.6.3
	* clang 3.0
	* SystemC 2.3.0
	* eglibc 2.15

= SystemC:   
	* Eliminate deprecation warning caused when running with SystemC 2.2.0 
	* Full support for System 2.3.0

* Switch INCLUDES to AM_CPPFLAGS in Makefile.am. INCLUDE in Makefile.am is deprecated.

* Add descriptive message to configure output. Example:
	prefix:                 /opt/archc
	sysconfdir:             ${prefix}/etc
	libdir:                 ${exec_prefix}/lib
	bindir:                 ${exec_prefix}/bin
	systemcdir:		/opt/systemc
	tlmdir:                 /opt/systemc/include
	binutilsdir:
	gdbdir:
	c compiler:             clang
	c++ compiler:           clang++
	cflags:                 -Werror -std=c99 -Wall
	cxxflags:               -Werror -std=c++03 -Wall
	ldflags:

= Fix random const issues in ac_storage

= Fix warning when running libtoolize
	The two or three argument AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE call was deprecated. Part
	of it was fixed in previous commits, this patch only suppresses the
	warning message about  it.

= Updating nightlytester to work with GIT and the new ARM model (which has a different model name).

+ Implemented fork syscall

+ MacOSX partially supported 
	* Adding macosx as a possible target to systemc in autoconf script
	* Small fix in boot script to support MacOSX libtoolize
	* ac_syscall modifications to support mac platforms
	* Add support for compiling ARCHC in MacOSX
