More
----

Remember that ArchC models and SystemC library must be compiled with
the same GCC version, otherwise you will get compilation problems.

Several documents which further information can be found in the 'doc'
subdirectory.

You can find language overview, models, and documentation at

Thanks for the interest. We hope you enjoy using ArchC!
