TO DO:
------

 - acasm, accsim etc (every tool except acsim) are old versions;
 - new ArchC parser (with support for ac_port and ac_int_port) must be added;
 - TLM libraries must be added;
 - fast instruction execution patch must be added;
 - ac_storage must be trimmed down, so that the read/write functions don't
	need the data size parameter (that may involve templates);
 - ac_memport must be expanded to deal with words of sc_(big)uint<> type;
 - acsim must be expanded so that:
	* words of sizes {8, 16, 32, 64} appear on the simulator source as
		types {uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t} respectively;
	* words of 'odd' size X < 64 appear on the simulator source as type
		sc_uint<X>;
	* words of size Y > 64 appear on the simulator source as type
		sc_biguint<Y>;
 - #ifdef and #ifndef statements must die. The behavior of certain libraries
	of ArchC mustn't be chosen at processor model compile time, but via
	some kind of configuration object, ac_config or something. This is
	necessary because different models, no matter how differently
	configured, will have to share the same library binary objects, to
	avoid great chaos;
 - all files must adhere to the new code comment & organization rules;
 - acsim must be cleaned, its deprecated functions must be removed;
 - delay dilemma: should the delay option continue to work?
