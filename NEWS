Changes in version 2.0beta1

* Binary utilities generation is carried out by acbingen.sh
script (assembler and linker generation)

* Assembler generation is now part of binary utilities

* Linker generation and integration with assembler added

* acsim simulation generation tool now only generates functional simulators
   (there will be a separate tool for cycle-accurate, called actsim)

* acsim-generated functional simulators are now up to 3~5 times faster
   compared to ArchC 1.6

* self-contained acsim-generated functional simulators: it's possible to
   instantiate multiple simulators and integrate them to your system model
   written in pure SystemC

* support for SystemC TLM communication: it is possible to declare TLM
   initiator ports on your processor, as well as interrupt ports

* preliminary interrupt handling mechanism support
