Changes in version 2.0beta2:
----------------------------

* Preliminary statistics collection support (counts total number of
instructions and syscalls, and for each instruction in the ISA, the number
of times it was executed)

* Preliminary TLM protocol support for bus/device locking/unlocking

* GDB support now done via proc.enable_gdb() (a port number may be passed as
an argument, otherwise it will work on port 5000)

* ac_pc value modification methods on the processor module, means you can
modify ac_pc via proc.set_ac_pc(val) or get the value of ac_pc by calling
proc.get_ac_pc()

* Several bugfixes


Changes in version 2.0beta1:
----------------------------

* Binary utilities generation is carried out by acbingen.sh
script (assembler and linker generation)

* Assembler generation is now part of binary utilities

* Linker generation and integration with assembler added

* acsim simulation generation tool now only generates functional simulators
   (there will be a separate tool for cycle-accurate, called actsim)

* acsim-generated functional simulators are now up to 3~5 times faster
   compared to ArchC 1.6

* self-contained acsim-generated functional simulators: it's possible to
   instantiate multiple simulators and integrate them to your system model
   written in pure SystemC

* support for SystemC TLM communication: it is possible to declare TLM
   initiator ports on your processor, as well as interrupt ports

* preliminary interrupt handling mechanism support
