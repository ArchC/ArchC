KNOWN BUGS IN ARCHC 2.0 BETA1
-----------------------------

 ** acsim:
      - Option -g (debug) does not do much, it only makes simulators generate
          a trace file with the program counter
      - Option -s (stats) does not work (model doesn't compile)
      - Option -vb (verbose) does not work (model doesn't compile)
      - Memory hierarchy does not work (it's not supported)
      - acsim runs on a cycle-accurate model without warnings or errors, and
          produces garbage instead of the required errors (since acsim should
          not generate cycle-accurate simulators)

 ** general:
      - accsim tool is not working
