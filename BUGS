KNOWN BUGS IN ARCHC 2.0 BETA1
----------------------------

 ** acsim:
      - Option -g (debug) does not do much, it only makes simulators generate a trace file with the program counter;
      - Option -s (stats) does not work (model doesn't compile);
      - Option -vb (verbose) does not work (model doesn't compile);
      - Memory hierarchy does not work (it's not supported);
      - acsim runs on a cycle-accurate model without warnings or errors, and produces garbage instead of the required errors (since acsim should not generate cycle-accurate simulators);
      - GDB can't find the address of the entry point of a program (_start on mips1), but except for this it seems to be working fine;
      - accsim tool is not working
