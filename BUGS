KNOWN BUGS IN ARCHC 2.0 BETA3
-----------------------------

 ** acsim:
     - Option -g (debug) does not do much, it only makes simulators generate
         a trace file with the program counter
     - Option -vb (verbose) does not work (model doesn't compile)
     - Memory hierarchy does not work (it's not supported)
     - acsim runs on a cycle-accurate model without warnings or errors, and
         produces garbage instead of the required errors (since acsim should
         not generate cycle-accurate simulators)

 ** actsim
     - GDB integration (option -gdb) does not work (not yet supported for cycle-
         accurate models)
     - Options -g (debug) does not do much, it only makes simulators generate
         a trace file with the program counter
     - Option -vb (verbose) does not work (model does not compile)
     - Memory hierarchy is not supported

 ** sourceforge acknowledged bugs:
     - 1473565 - problem while loading application files on a big-endian host


KNOWN BUGS IN ARCHC 2.0 BETA2
-----------------------------

 ** acsim:
     - Option -g (debug) does not do much, it only makes simulators generate
         a trace file with the program counter
     - Option -vb (verbose) does not work (model doesn't compile)
     - Memory hierarchy does not work (it's not supported)
     - acsim runs on a cycle-accurate model without warnings or errors, and
         produces garbage instead of the required errors (since acsim should
         not generate cycle-accurate simulators)

 ** actsim:
     - Instantiation of multiple processors does not work properly
     - GDB integration (option -gdb) does not work (not yet supported for cycle-
         accurate models)
     - Options -g and -vb are the same as in acsim
     - Programs with multiple simulator instances will compile, but not run
         properly
     - Memory hierarchy is not supported

 ** general:
     - accsim tool is not working

 ** sourceforge acknowledged bugs:
     - 1473565 - problem while loading application files on a big-endian host
