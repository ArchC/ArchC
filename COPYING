   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION


This license extends to all Programs contained in the package that
you received, including all subdirectories from this root, except if
the file header indicates another license.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. 

  1. You may copy verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, for personal use, provided that you copy
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; and keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty.

Personal use can be extended to a laboratory facility or a shared room
only if you are in charge of a research group that contributes to this
program and only with developing and research purposes.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must not share, publish or distribute this program, either
    in parts or in original form. You must not share, publish or
    distribute programs that use this Program, either in parts or in
    its original form.


  3. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or using the Program (or any work based on the Program), you
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or
works based on it.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the software in its development phase.  

			    NO WARRANTY

  4. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
