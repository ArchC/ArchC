LICENSE
=======

 - ArchC tools are  provided under the GNU GPL license. See
   COPYING file for details on this license.

 - ArchC utility library, i.e., all  files stored in the src directory
   of the ArchC source tree are provided under the  GNU  LGPL license.

INSTALL
=======

- Run make

ArchC will build its tools  and place them inside the "bin" directory,
and the installation script will prompt you every time it needs to set
a  configuration variable.   Notice  that the  script  will suggest  a
default value for  each variable, if you think that it  is OK for your
installation you  just press enter to  confirm it.  This  data will be
stored at the archc.conf file, in the config directory.


MORE INFO
=========

  Remember that ArchC models and SystemC library must be compiled with
  the same GCC version, otherwise you will get compilation problems.
  
  You can find a language overview, models, and documentation at
  http://www.archc.org



Thanks for the interest. We hope you enjoy using ArchC!
