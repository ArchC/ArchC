BUILDING THE PACKAGE
====================

ArchC package uses the GNU autotools framework to build the source
files and install them into the host system. General instructions 
regarding autotools basic installation can be found in INSTALL file.

In brief:

  1. enter ArchC root source tree (you may as well create a new
directory for use in the building process)
  2. execute:
    ./configure --with-systemc=<systemc-path>
  
  NOTES:
    a) --with-systemc flag is -MANDATORY-. Other optional flags include:
    --with-binutils=<binutils-path> -> if you plan to generate binary 
                                       utilities
    --with-tlm=<tlm-path> -> if you want the new ArchC TLM communication
                               capabilities

    b) by default, the installation process will install the package in
    the /usr/local directory. If you want any other directory to be used,
    just use the --prefix flag.

  3. make
  4. make install
