Overview
--------

The ArchC system calls library (libac_sysc.a) instruments the
aplications to interface virtual calls with real host system calls.

The GCC cross-compiled to the target architecture must be configured
to use this library.


How to create/configure a cross-compiler for an ArchC description
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately at this point it is not possible to automatically
generate a cross-compiler back-end from an ArchC description. A GCC
cross-compiler can only be generated for architectures already
supported by GCC.

Please, take a look at "Retargeting GCC to ArchC models" in the
Documentation section of ArchC web site for more information on how to
create and configure a GCC cross-compiler to create aplications
compatible with ArchC simulators.


Thanks for using ArchC!
