Overview
--------

The ArchC system calls library (libac_sysc.a) instruments the
aplications to interface virtual calls with real host system calls.

The GCC cross-compiled to the target architecture must be generated
and added to PATH environment. Compiling the library:

    make TARGET=mips-newlib-elf

The output file (libac_sysc.a) must be moved to:

$(CROSS_PATH)/$(CROSS_TUPLE)/lib/

Where CROSS_TUPLE could be 'mips-newlib-elf', 'powerpc-newlib-elf', etc.

How to create/configure a cross-compiler for an ArchC description
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately at this point it is not possible to automatically
generate a cross-compiler back-end from an ArchC description. A GCC
cross-compiler can only be generated for architectures already
supported by GCC.

Thanks for using ArchC!
