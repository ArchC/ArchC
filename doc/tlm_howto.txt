HOW-TO: ARCHC 2.0 TLM FEATURES
------------------------------


1. TLM initiator port

   ArchC 2.0 provides a TLM initiator port to your processor, allowing
   it to communicate with external modules. In order to create a TLM
   initiator port, you have to declare it on the modelname.ac
   file. Here's an example we made with our mips1 model, replacing the
   DM element from ac_cache to ac_tlm_port:
AC_ARCH(mips1){
  //ac_cache    DM:5M;
  ac_tlm_port DM:5M;
  ac_regbank  RB:32;
//...

   We substituted the ac_cache (main memory) with an ac_tlm_port
   because we want to use this model with an external TLM memory. Now
   all you have to do is run acsim and it will generate the simulator
   code with the ac_tlm_port already in place. Please note that a
   range must be declared with the ac_tlm_port, indicating the range
   of addresses (starting on 0x0) that will be accessible via the port
   (in this case, 5 megabytes).

   One important thing about ArchC 2.0 is that the processor access to
   either ac_tlm_ports or internal memories (elements of type
   ac_storage) is always made via an ac_memport. In this case, the
   ac_memport correspondent to the ac_tlm_port we've declared will be
   called DM, and the port itself will be called DM_port. That is, the
   ac_tlm_port gets a '_port' suffix in its name.

   All right, now an illustration of how this works. Whenever you want
   to access the port from the inside of the processor, that is, on
   instruction behaviors, for instance, you use the ac_memport called
   DM, like this (in the modelname_isa.cpp file):
value = DM.read(address);

   However, all access to this port from outside the processor will
   have to use the ac_tlm_port object, which in this case is called
   DM_port. The main use of this will be in binding the port to an
   external module, like this:
proc_instance.DM_port(ext_memory);

   Which is a binding of the port present in proc_instance to an
   external memory ext_memory.

   After that, what you absolutely need to know is what to implement
   in the external modules so that communication is possible. And that
   is known as the ArchC TLM protocol. It works like this: an
   ac_tlm_port is-a (ie, extends) sc_port<ac_tlm_transport_if>, where
   ac_tlm_transport_if is the same as tlm_transport_if<ac_tlm_req,
   ac_tlm_rsp>.

   Basically this means that you can only bind an ac_tlm_port to a
   module that extends ac_tlm_transport_if (which would be,
   technically, a channel) or to an sc_export<ac_tlm_transport_if>
   that is bound to such an object.

   So the first requisite is that your external module responsible for
   communicating directly with the processor must inherit from
   ac_tlm_transport_if.

   That obliges this module ext_module to implement the:
ac_tlm_rsp ext_module::transport(const ac_tlm_req& req);

   method that is declared by tlm_transport_if<>. This method will
   receive a reference to an ArchC TLM transaction request packet
   (declared at the ac_tlm_protocol.H file), process it accordingly,
   and return an ArchC TLM transaction response packet (also declared
   at the ac_tlm_protocol.H) informing the transaction requester (that
   is, our processor module) of the transaction status, whether it
   failed or succeeded.

   By doing this on the external slave module, you're ready to go!
   Just bind the port from the processor instance to the module or
   module export and you can already access it via the read/write
   methods of the ac_memport DM, inside the instruction behaviors.


2. TLM interrupt port

   ArchC 2.0 also features communication initiated from an external
   module, with the processor module as a slave, via its interrupt
   mechanism. To enable an interrupt mechanism on your model, first
   you have to declare an ac_tlm_intr_port on the modelname.ac
   file. As an example, you can add an interrupt port to our mips1
   model just by doing this:
AC_ARCH(mips1){

  ac_cache   DM:5M;
  ac_regbank RB:32;

  ac_tlm_intr_port inta; // Add this line
//...

   Great! Now we have an interrupt port on our mips1 model, called
   inta. By running the acsim tool on it, we'll see that it generated
   some extra files related to interrupts. The one we'll modify is
   modelname_intr_handlers.cpp. First, we'll copy
   modelname_intr_handlers.cpp.tmpl to
   modelname_intr_handlers.cpp. Then we'll edit the file.

   When you open the file, you'll see that it contains an ac_behavior
   definition, pretty much in the same way as the modelname_isa.cpp
   file:
// Interrupt handler behavior for interrupt port inta.
void ac_behavior(inta, value) {
}

   Inside this ac_behavior, you can write pretty much standard
   behavior code, altering register values, the program counter,
   writing or reading the memory... Basically, this behavior code
   represents whatever the processor hardware does when it encounters
   an interrupt. Note that it receives a value from the interrupt,
   which can be used on the interrupt handling. Your choice
   really. Another possibility is declaring more than one
   ac_tlm_intr_ports on the modelname.ac file, which will lead to each
   of them having its separate interrupt handler method defined on
   this modelname_intr_handlers.cpp file. So there are lots of options
   to implement interrupt behavior on your model. The ArchC interrupt
   system is very flexible because we don't want to hinder the
   developers' options.

   Now that we know how interrupts work inside the processor, what we
   have to understand is how an external module interrupts the
   processor. First, whenever you declare an ac_tlm_intr_port on your
   modelname.ac it means that you will have an ac_tlm_intr_port as a
   member of your modelname module.

   This ac_tlm_intr_port will have the exact same name you declare on
   modelname.ac, which in this case is inta. The ac_tlm_intr_port is-a
   (inherits from) sc_export<ac_tlm_transport_if>, and this export is
   bound to itself, because ac_tlm_intr_port also implements the
   transport() method mentioned above, and this transport() method has
   a fixed implementation, which calls an interrupt handler that is
   bound to a port (those are the ones you implement on the
   modelname_intr_handlers.cpp, one for each port).

   Then, to make an external module interrupt a processor, all you
   have to do is binding an sc_port<ac_tlm_transport_if> of this
   module to the ac_tlm_intr_port of the processor, like this:
ext_module.out_port(proc_module.inta);

   and then have the external module call the transport() method via
   this port, passing an ac_tlm_req transaction request
   packet. Whatever value there is on the data field of the packet
   will be passed as the 'value' parameter of the interrupt handler.


   This small tutorial covers how to use the TLM features of this
   ArchC 2.0 beta. However, if you have any doubts, questions or
   suggestions regarding the ArchC TLM features, feel free to contact
   us ArchC developers, preferrably via the forums, to hear from you
   and answer your questions.
